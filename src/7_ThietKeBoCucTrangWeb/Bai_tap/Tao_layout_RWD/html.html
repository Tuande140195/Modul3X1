                <p>Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before
                    signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would
                    also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club
                    World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most
                    expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth
                    €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey
                    and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He and won back-to-back
                    Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind
                    Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an
                    initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most
                    expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe
                    Italiana and a Coppa Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021.</p></div>
